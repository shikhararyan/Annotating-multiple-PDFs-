# Annotating-multiple-PDFs-
This project aims to automate the process of highlighting specific keywords within PDF documents. Leveraging the PyMuPDF library (fitz module), along with pandas for handling keyword data stored in CSV format, the script systematically searches through each page of the PDF documents, identifies the keywords, and highlights them.
